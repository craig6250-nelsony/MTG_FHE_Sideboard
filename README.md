# Encrypted Sideboard: A Confidential Experience in Magic: The Gathering

The Encrypted Sideboard is an innovative Magic: The Gathering experience that seamlessly incorporates **Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption technology**. This project empowers players to maintain the secrecy of their sideboard strategies, enhancing the tactical depth and excitement of competitive card play. By utilizing advanced encryption methods, participants can fortify their gameplay while ensuring that their strategic intentions remain concealed from opponents.

## Unveiling the Challenge

In the realm of competitive card games like Magic: The Gathering, players face a significant challenge during tournaments: the need to adapt strategies quickly and covertly against opponents. This necessity often leads to information leakage, where players may unintentionally reveal their tactics through their choice of sideboard cards. The pressure to not only choose wisely but also protect one's strategy can be daunting. 

## How FHE Solves the Problem

The Encrypted Sideboard addresses this issue head-on through the implementation of **Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)**, leveraged via **Zama's open-source libraries** such as the **Concrete** and **TFHE-rs** SDKs. By encrypting sideboard lists and the exchange process, players can make strategic decisions without exposing them to their opponents. This encryption ensures that even during the gameplay, the information remains confidential, introducing a new layer of intrigue and strategy. 

## Core Features 🎴✨

- **FHE-Encrypted Sideboard Lists**: Players can securely store and manage their sideboard cards, ensuring that their choices are only visible to themselves.
- **Confidential Exchange Process**: The process of swapping cards remains private, adding an element of surprise and strategy during matches.
- **Enhanced Information Warfare**: Players can engage in tactical gameplay without fear of revealing critical information to their opponents.
- **Designed for High-Competitive Scenarios**: Tailored for tournaments and professional play, where strategy and secrecy are paramount.
  
## Technology Stack 🛠️

- **Zama’s Fully Homomorphic Encryption SDK**
- **Node.js** for backend support
- **Hardhat** or **Foundry** for smart contract development
- **Solidity** for smart contract implementation
- **React** for the user interface (optional, if implemented)

## Getting Started 🚀

To set up the Encrypted Sideboard project, follow these instructions. Ensure you have **Node.js** and either **Hardhat** or **Foundry** installed on your machine.

1. **Download the Project**: Ensure you have the project files on your local machine—do not use `git clone`.
2. **Install Dependencies**: Navigate to the project directory in your terminal and run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   This command will fetch all necessary dependencies, including Zama FHE libraries.
3. **Set Up Environment**: Ensure all configurations are set correctly in your environment to leverage Zama's SDK effectively.

## Build & Run Instructions 🏗️

Once the project is set up, you can compile and run it using the following commands:

1. **Compile the Smart Contracts**:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat compile
   ```

2. **Run Tests**: Ensure everything is working as intended by executing:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat test
   ```

3. **Deploy the Smart Contracts**: Deploy on your desired network:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network <network-name>
   ```

4. **Interact with the Application**: To swap cards or interact with the gameplay, execute:
   ```bash
   node scripts/swap.js
   ```

## Sample Code Snippet 📜

In order to demonstrate how the encrypted sideboard feature works, here's a simplified example of how players can manage their sideboard:

```javascript
const { Concrete, encryptSideboard, swapCards } = require('zama-fhe-sdk');

async function manageSideboard(playerId, sideboardCards) {
    const encryptedSideboard = await encryptSideboard(sideboardCards);
    console.log(`Encrypted Sideboard for Player ${playerId}: ${encryptedSideboard}`);

    const swapProcess = await swapCards(playerId, encryptedSideboard);
    console.log(`Successfully swapped cards: ${swapProcess}`);
}

// Example usage
manageSideboard('Player1', ['CardA', 'CardB', 'CardC']);
```

This example illustrates how players encrypt their sideboard and perform swaps without exposure, utilizing Zama's powerful encryption capabilities.
